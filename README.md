# EMEA ES Payroll Bulk Directive

Project Title: EMEA ES Payroll Bulk Directive

# Description
The end user must fill out an input form with data that must be transformed into a format recognized by South African Revenue Services and stored in a database or repository. The South African Revenue Services must get this data in bulk in order for them to review it and take appropriate action.

Proposed Solution:
Implement an integrated and user-friendly software system that facilitates seamless data entry and storage, automates the conversion process to meet SARS standards, and enables efficient management of the entire workflow. This solution not only enhances data accuracy and security but also diminishes reliance on external parties, thereby reducing associated costs for Kumba and Platinum Payroll. By automating this process, Anglo American was able to reduce time, improve accuracy, and control costs while submitting Tax Directive requests to the South African Revenue Services. This eliminated the need for a third party to do the activity on behalf of Kumba and Platinum Payroll.
